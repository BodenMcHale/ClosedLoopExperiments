# Inscribed Rectangle Problem Visualization

Interactive visualization tool for exploring the Inscribed Rectangle Problem - a mathematical conjecture about rectangle inscribability in Jordan curves.

## Features
- Interactive closed loop with draggable points
- Color-coded vertices: yellow/magenta and sandybrown/palevioletred
- Cyan connection lines between vertex pairs
- Teal midpoint indicators
- Springgreen intersection point
- Dark background with turquoise grid and white center axes
- Real-time coordinate tracking (0.0-1.0)

## Mathematical Context
The inscribed rectangle problem is a fundamental question in geometry, asking whether every Jordan curve contains the vertices of a rectangle [1]. While the inscribed square problem remains open for general curves [2], recent work by Cole and Shiu has made significant progress on inscribed rectangles using geometric foliation theory [3]. This visualization tool helps explore possible rectangle configurations, inspired by Haraguchi's topological approach [4] and recent breakthroughs in the field [5].

## Requirements
